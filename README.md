# Example-Of-Homework
This is one of my homework assignments I did in the courses I have taken.

Although this project is not built from scratch, I did the entirety of the significant implementations that makes this project function properly.

Here is what I did
1. Downloaded sign language MNIST data set
2. Parsed data from CSV file into NumPy arrays
3. Created ImageDataGenerator objects to create test and validation data my neural network could actually train on. Implemented data augmentation to increase the amount of testing data.
4. Built a convolutional neural network and trained it eventually reaching a validation accuracy of 96%

Skills gained:
1. Parsing data in CSV files
2. Data Augmentation
3. Building highly accurate CNNs
